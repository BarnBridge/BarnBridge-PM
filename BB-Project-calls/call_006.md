## Tech/Dev

Dragos: Hello, everyone. First thing, BarnBridge Appâ€” Yield Farming. Monday last week, there was a front end bug. Luckily we solved it quickly. The bug was caused by a list of transactions recieved from the sub-graph. It was saved in the session storage, the session storage filled up and resulted in a front end crash for a lot of user browsers. Not that bad of a problemâ€” too many transactions.
 
We addressed it by not saving the session storage in the same way as before. The result is a not so good user experience when currently navigating the app. With our goal of a better user experience. We started moving away from the graph. We started implementing our own packing component, added some UI updatesâ€” epoch graphs are being updated.

Here is a sneak peak, and we will soon roll a release for these updates. Either later in the day today or tomorrow. The updates allow the graphs and transaction lists to load a lot quicker. Creating a better user experience.
 
#### BBDAO
 
Bogdan: Smart contracts are now 100% done. We are working on improving test coverage, doing some internal reviews. As far as design goes, a third of it has already been implemented in the front end. We are just connecting it to the test net contracts. Shout out to "Slava" he's been killing it with the front end work on both the Yied Farming and the DAO at the same time. 

Dragos: I think we can show the community a bit of what this is going to look like. I don't think that's going to be a problem. Let me share my screen. 

Bogdan: Small spoiler. ðŸ˜Ž
