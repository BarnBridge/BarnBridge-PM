## Intro

**Troy:** Welcome to project call 009! We are very close to the release of the DAO. I'll be handing it over to Akin. For an update on the news this week covering DeFi Alliance & Standards. Then he will have to hop off.

## DeFi Alliance / Standards 
> [Update](https://twitter.com/qwqiao/status/1351172408963719169?s=21)– In case you missed it

**Akin:** With standards, we are pretty much done. We are just doing some final reviews. We should have something to publish in the next couple of days. There should be something available for the community to engage with and provide feedback.

We joined a Defi Alliance accelerator program.  It starts this week. A lot of it is building relationships with MM's(Market makers), LP's(Liquidity providers) and other projects in the DeFi ecosystem. The alliance will help us engage various stakeholders who may have an interest in BarnBridge. What their needs are. What frictions there may be. And how we can support them from a product and UI/UX perspective.

That's about it. Short and sweet.

**Troy:** Yep, short and sweet. Very nice. 

Alright, we're going to let you hop off because you have some stuff to do with the DeFi Alliance. So we will see you later ser! Good luck with everything over there.

Hopping into the tech and dev side, we will be handing it off to Dragos–the one and only! For an update on what is going on. 

Please ser.
