## Intro

**Troy:** Welcome to project call 009! We are very close to the release of the DAO. I'll be handing it over to Akin. For an update on the news this week covering DeFi Alliance & Standards. Then he will have to hop off.

## DeFi Alliance / Standards 
> [Update](https://twitter.com/qwqiao/status/1351172408963719169?s=21)â€“ In case you missed it

**Akin:** With standards, we are pretty much done. We are just doing some final reviews. We should have something to publish in the next couple of days. There should be something available for the community to engage with and provide feedback.

We joined a Defi Alliance accelerator program.  It starts this week. A lot of it is building relationships with MM's(Market makers), LP's(Liquidity providers) and other projects in the DeFi ecosystem. The alliance will help us engage various stakeholders who may have an interest in BarnBridge. What their needs are. What frictions there may be. And how we can support them from a product and UI/UX perspective.

That's about it. Short and sweet.

**Troy:** Yep, short and sweet. Very nice. 

Alright, we're going to let you hop off because you have some stuff to do with the DeFi Alliance. So we will see you later ser! Good luck with everything over there.

Hopping into the tech and dev side, we will be handing it off to Dragosâ€“the one and only! For an update on what is going on. 

Please ser.

**Dragos:** I'm just going to start it off and then hand it over to Bogdan. I'm going to mention this one thing I'll share on my screen in a secondâ€“ if I can find the correct one!

We have the BarnBridge snapshot up. You can now search up BarnBridge, where you will find our page and proposals.

You can use two links to get there:
https://signal.barnbridge.com/
https://snapshot.page/#/barnbridge.eth

All the discussions will take place on Github. We are still tweaking things, but we will be ready for the DAO launch.

With that said, I'm going to stop sharing my screen.

I'm going to hand it off to Mr. Bogdan G. You all know him. You all love him.
