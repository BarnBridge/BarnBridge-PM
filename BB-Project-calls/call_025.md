## Intro [[00:00]](https://youtu.be/E0nlS9S8VGA)

**Christian:** Hey, everyone! Welcome to BarnBridge project call 25!

We have several things to talk through today. Everyone's heads down, gearing up for the Smart Alpha launch in a couple of weeks.

To kick things off, I will pass it over to Bogdan for any tech/dev updates. 

## Tech/Dev [[00:25]](https://youtu.be/E0nlS9S8VGA?t=25)

**Bogdan:** I think this will be one of my shortest dev updates. We have focused 100% on Smart Alpha for the past few weeks. And we will likely continue to do so over the following month. There is no reason to dilute the main event with anything else. 

Right now, we have the app for Smart Alpha 99% done. We are taking our time putting everything in its place, testing, retesting etc. 

All the functionality is there. Now it's about going through the final UI polishes. For the release timeline ‚Äì our hope is that the simulator will be up tomorrow. There is a slight problem. We have delayed it by a few days to incorporate the feedback we received for the models. We are playing with a couple of different versions of Smart Alpha. We are tweaking parameters so that Juniors and Seniors have fair deals. 

Next up, we will open the app for pre-deposits. (Sometime next week) This means we will allow people to deposit into the deposit queue for the Junior or Senior side. Then you will officially be part of the first epoch when it launches on Monday, September the 13th. Not the following Monday, but the one after that. 

That is our current plan. And that means by the time we see each other next community call, Smart Alpha will be live.

That's all I have for updates. 

Thank you, guys!

**Christian:** Nice! 

Thanks, Bogdan! 

## Operations [[02:26]](https://youtu.be/E0nlS9S8VGA?t=146)

**Christian:** On the operations side. Nothing is too pressing ‚Äì in terms of priorities.

## Priorities

**Christian:** Our primary focus is an effective launch. We are working with several meaningful channels around Smart Alpha. 

On the B/D side (Business development), we will have more to share later this month‚Äì when the app is live.

With that, I'll pass it over the Max to talk about other items on the operations side.

## Max  [[02:55]](https://youtu.be/E0nlS9S8VGA?t=175)

My most recent focus has been setting up (For lack of better terms) service providers ‚Äì our approach with the Smart Alpha launch.

### UMA KPI Option Partnership & Rari Fuse Pool

Primarily what I mean by that, I have been working with the UMA team to think through how they can become the standard provider for rewards programs in the future for Smart Alpha and the near term.

Once Smart Yield is addressed ‚Äì that can be looked at as well. This has been going well. There is a [forum post](https://forum.barnbridge.com/t/uma-kpi-options-partnership-for-sa/455) detailing how UMA is thinking about a template implementation. 

How it would work; 

On a pool-by-pool basis, there can be parallel KPI option programs running. 

We are striking partnerships with specific communities that would like to incentivize secondary liquidity for their token's Junior/Senior Smart Alpha pools. 

That is also going very well. I think what we can do is have a pilot during the initial epochs following launch. We can utilize the Bitcoin and Ethereum Smart Alpha pools.

The pilot lets us have something in practice to analyze. (See how the program went) We can then boil it down to a template that can be brought to other communities. Other projects can set aside their token to incentivize a pool that works for them.  

### Balancer Secondary Liquidity for SA

That's one element. The other is aimed at a question of secondary liquidity. (For Junior/Senior ERC20 assets ‚Äì with a very long tail)

For that, I have been speaking with the Balancer team. They are interested in helping us create a standard Balancer pool type. Over a weekly basis, epochs come and go, and Junior dominance changes‚Äì so, the pool automatically reweights the underlying asset, junior, senior asset. The Junior and Senior cancel out. And you can absorb the volatility from the Junior. 

This allows you to get enough secondary liquidity for Senior assets to be used elsewhere in DeFi. (Without worries about liquidity) 

That conversation is newer. But it sounds like the other teams are excited about that prospect. It will be something we try and push over the next week or so. That way, we can gauge what kind of lift it is and how we can go about establishing a Balancer pool template.

Those are the two things I'm most excited about. It leads to continuing to augment our Rari Fuse pool. 

### Smart Alpha Awareness Plans

With all that said, that's the pre-launch focus. 

After launch, we will be going to communities and various Discord servers. (From here to the ends of the earth) üåçüèÉüí®

We can advertise Smart Alpha. Both the modeller on the front end and the services we can offer through Balancer & UMA.

This way, we can have fruitful conversations with other teams. Where the community votes in favour of dedicating resources to Smart Alpha. Over the past month and a half, we have done a lot of private outreach with teams. The feedback has led to a lot of improvements/polishes before launch. However, those teams cannot speak for their communities. 

They would like to see it in action. But, it's on us to do general AMAs and general educational efforts across the various communities. That is the B/D focus for the months after launch. Obtaining as many partner programs for individual Smart Alpha pools. 

That is where we currently sit on the business development side. That is it for me, Christian. 

**Christian:** Thanks, Max! 

Trevor, anything you would like to chat through on your side?

**Trevor:** Nothing at the moment. Thanks, Christian!

**Christian:** Okay, cool!

With that, I will open it up to Tyler and Milad. 

Anything you guys want to chat through that is pressing for this call?

**Tyler:** I can let Milad go first.

**Milad:** No, I am good. 

**Tyler:** I think we are all on the same page. We are heads down on Smart Alpha. It has been a long time coming, and we are excited about it. 

Max has been banging out on the biz dev side. I have seen some talk in the community about a significant update that is coming for BarnBridge. But, there is not a ton of buzz around it. I have also said before, the buzz is a double-edged sword. 

I think everyone is used to the fact we like to do slow launches and roll everything out, so it all works properly. I believe the hype around Smart Alpha should be about uptick, usage and utility ‚Äì and that's what we've focused on.

I think we lost Troy. His internet probably went out ‚Äì Puerto Rico. üòÇ

**Christian:** I don't see any questions. I think that's all, so we can break early and get back to work on this. Anything else, guys?

Or are we good to call if for today?

**Tyler:** I think we are good!

**Christian:** Awesome! Well, thank you, everyone!

**Everyone:** ‚úåÔ∏è ‚úåÔ∏è ‚úåÔ∏è ‚úåÔ∏è ‚úåÔ∏è
