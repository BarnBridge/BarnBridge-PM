## Intro [[00:00]](https://youtu.be/s1p0JXutaVg)

**Christian:** Hey everyone! Welcome to BarnBridge project call 24!

As Troy mentioned last week, I will take the lead on these going forward.

To kick things off. I will pass it over to Bogdan to run through any pressing dev updates. After that, we will walk through the operations side.


## Tech/Dev [[00:21]](https://youtu.be/s1p0JXutaVg?t=21)

**Bogdan:** Yes, thank you, new MC.

I will keep this update focused on Smart Alpha. That's the most pressing developer update that I can address.

### Smart Alpha (Audit report)

**Bogdan:** We published the full audit report of Smart Alpha last week. Everything is fine on that front. You can check it out on our [Github](https://github.com/BarnBridge/BarnBridge-PM). It's in the project management repo.

### Gnosis Safe App

**Bogdan:** We also finished our Gnosis safe integration – In preparation for the launch of Smart Alpha. The app will be entirely functional and available from the start— as a Gnosis Safe app.

We are pretty much fully focused on wrapping up the front-end for Smart Alpha. Everything else gets completed. We are less than a month away from launch. (I hope a few weeks) 

A simulator will be available for everyone to use. The simulator will come slightly earlier than the launch, which will allow you to see how your Smart Alpha position would perform in various price conditions and pool compositions. Both as a Senior or Junior— you can compare the performance of your position using Smart Alpha or not. 

Aside from the Smart Alpha updates on the Smart contract front and R&D, we're currently working on a v2 for Smart Yield. (We have a first draft for it)

Version two will solve a lot of issues that we received feedback on. The largest update for that compared to the first version. It works hand in hand with our Smart Fiat spec. Smart Fiat is also making slow and steady progress. We are making sure everything works well with all of our products. 

I believe I teased this on the last call. We are still sketching out the specs for the following product. It is something super, super awesome.

I do not want to distract everyone from Smart Alpha. We are completely focused on Smart Alpha. It is coming soon. 


## Operations [[02:58]](https://youtu.be/s1p0JXutaVg?t=178)

**Christian:** Thanks, Bogdan! 

Before I pass it over to Pavlo and Max for details on what we are working on. 

### Smart Alpha (Launch planning)

**Christian:** Our priorities on the operation side remain the same. Smart Alpha launch planning. Everything from marketing to aligning with the developer team on timing. Our goal is to launch this product effectively and successfully.

Other priorities; Bogdan referenced this. We have been running product roadmap sessions. (Internally)

We are trying to layout the coming three, six & nine months, at least the working version. We will continue that over the next few weeks.

### Business Development

**Chrisitan:** On the business development side. We are having initial outreach as we near the Smart Alpha launch. There is nothing too detailed to share, only that those things will continue to ramp up as we move forward.

With that, I will pass it over to Pavlo then Max.

## Pavlo [[03:55]](https://youtu.be/s1p0JXutaVg?t=235)

Hello, everyone!

I have three quick updates to share. 

### What is BarnBridge (Explainer video)

Firstly, I can not wait until we release the "What is BarnBridge?" explainer video. It's fire. 🔥🔥🔥

We're making the final preparations for it and adding final touches to the animations/background music. 

The video will get released soon!

### Smart Alpha (Media outreach)

We're looking to do media outreach. We have had contact with a few different media outlets and newsletters. And this will be something that we have planned for Smart Alpha. (Content plan)

### Smart Alpha (Community-AMA)

Last but not least! We'll likely be hosting a community AMA around Smart Alpha. That should happen closer to the date of launch. We'll announce everything ahead of time. 

We'll be collecting questions from the community beforehand. Then we'll host the AMA session. It will likely be with Max and me. But, we'll see. 

There will be more details about that later.

That's it. I will pass it along to Max!

## Max [[05:38]](https://youtu.be/s1p0JXutaVg?t=338)

Thanks, Pavlo!

### Socialization: Smart Alpha

As Christian alluded to, we've been doing a few week's worths of private socialization for Smart Alpha. 

Meaning we've been speaking to many teams far and wide, giving a sneak preview of Smart Alpha. That way, it is in their minds, and they can begin thinking about how it is helpful to them. 

I believe I spoke about this before. Smart Alpha is compatible with any ERC-20 token, granted it has a Chainlink price oracle. (Right off the draw)

The opportunities for partnerships are quite extensive as a result. We've got plenty of good feedback over the last few weeks. We'll be using that to inform our strategy around public announcements in the lead-up to Smart Alpha— the actual product launch. 

### Potential Service Provider Partners: Smart Alpha

From those initial conversations, we made some great headway with a few teams. I'm hoping we'll be in a position to solidify some partnerships In two ways.

I've been calling it a service provider front. Meaning, we can partner with teams both for secondary liquidity (Smart Alpha assets) and incentivization programs. 

That's still in the works, and more details about it will get released closer to launch. 

### Senior Smart Yield Rewards (Program Status)

Aside from Smart Alpha, this is a reminder that there are two ongoing programs. 

The first is the Smart Yield Senior tranche rewards are still live through September 1st!

Around six million in deposits have got made to date. I believe the average amount of BOND getting distributed is around, 1,200 BOND and the median is around 380/400 BOND.

Check it out and see if one of the Seniors is screaming your name for the remainder of the program.  

### OpenDeFi Hackathon

There is also the OpenDeFi hackathon, which began yesterday. And for those who haven't seen what we've sponsored. We're doing two integrations and one free-form project.

The two integrations:

1. [MaskNetwork Integration](https://gitcoin.co/issue/BarnBridge/Bounty-Program/14/100026336)
- This integration would allow any user to click a link on a tweet and begin interacting with Smart Yield right there.

> Ex; #jUSD - brings up the entire Smart Yield app via a popup. 

I believe they have integrated with a large number of teams. (Double-digits)

2. [InstaDapp Integration](https://gitcoin.co/issue/BarnBridge/Bounty-Program/15/100026337)

Freeform project: [Smart Yield Plugin](https://gitcoin.co/issue/BarnBridge/Bounty-Program/16/100026349)

The third item is a fun, freeform project. The idea is to build an app that allows users to mint an sBOND with a specific generative art algorithm. 

Essentially, the app gets built, and then ten artists submit algorithms for the artwork. When you mint an sBOND, you can choose which one you will like. I think this is a cool concept to align with the sBOND's because they are NFTs. 

Maybe there are fringe scenarios where the art becomes more valuable than the deposit. In which case, you do not redeem the sBOND, and you keep the art. The sBOND will continue to make money for the Junior side.

We are sponsoring those three at the moment. If you have not seen the bounties, be sure to check those out!

Consider me a resource. If you have any questions, send me a direct message on Discord.  

### Rari Fuse

My final update. We're working on updating our Rari fuse pool to add FEI. They'll be depositing one million in liquidity into the pool. (When it's live)

We are running into some technical difficulties trying to add liquidity. Ideally, that gets resolved in the next day or so.

If the current DAO vote passes and we can create secondary liquidity for pairs of jTokens. We can add those within the week as well. I think our fuse pool is well on its way to becoming a lending market for Smart Yield/Alpha derivative tokens. 

That should be a fascinating experiment. I'm excited to see that play out over the next month or two. 

Otherwise, that's all I have.

**Christian:** Thanks, guys! 

Tyler, Troy, Milad, any thoughts you would like to add?

**Tyler:** I have a little bit. 

I feel we are doing a lot behind the scenes, what Pavlo is doing with the video. I thought it was super dope that someone found a slight bug via the bug bounty. 

So, people are looking at our contracts and working with all of us. It wasn't anything critical. But it's always good to have a second set of eyes on things. We've been going through all of the audits. The dev team is busting their ass. A lot of what Christian is doing behind the scenes is dope. 

A lot of these integrations that they're doing— I'm not sure what to term them. They are not DeFi integrations. They are working with groups that will help us in a more traditional sense. (I don't want to name-drop any companies)

They are more traditional integrations. That opens up the ability for us to do more in the future with TradFi groups. 

Max has been absolutely toiling away with integrations for Smart Alpha and making sure the parameters set for Smart Alpha will make the integrations/business dev stuff work. 

I'll say there is a lot more groundswell going on for what's coming next month. (Compared to what it looks like on the outside)

I'm excited about it.

**Milad:** I'm very excited for Smart Alpha. It's a unique problem, and I'm looking forward to seeing people using it. 

**Tyler:** Yeah, me too. 😏

**Christian:** Awesome. Anything else, guys? 

I don't see any questions. Is there anything else you guys wanted to chat about today?

**Pavlo:** Just a reminder – voting for proposal number five is running. So, make sure you vote. 

**Christian:** Awesome!

I guess with that, we can close things out. 

Thanks, everyone! Talk to you all soon.

**Everyone:** ✌️✌️ ✌️✌️ ✌️✌️
