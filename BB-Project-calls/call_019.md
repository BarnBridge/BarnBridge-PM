## Intro [[00:00]](https://youtu.be/4dMYdgv8-PY)

**Troy:** Alright, everyone, welcome to BarnBridge project call 19!

As some of you may notice, we have a new face around here. 

So, I'll let him introduce himself. 

Christian, would you like to introduce yourself, please?

### Introduction: [Christian Crowley](https://twitter.com/ChrisCCrowley)

**Christian:** Sure, thanks, Troy!

Hey, everyone, Christian Crowley here. I'm joining the operations team‚Äì to help drive operations and business development. My background is in blockchain. I spent two and half years at Consensys with a few guys on this call‚Äì helping to lead the [Alethio](https://twitter.com/AlethioEthstats) project. 

I'm joining from AWS. Where I've spent the last year building blockchain partnerships with early-stage startups. 

Looking forward to joining the team and growing BarnBridge.

**Troy:** Awesome, it's great to have you here. 

Without further ado, we're going to turn it to the tech team for updates on everything that is going on. 

They're not major updates, but the timeline and the understanding of what's coming are beneficial to the community. 


## Tech/Dev [[01:10]](https://youtu.be/4dMYdgv8-PY?t=70)

**Bogdan:** Nothing too flashy with the tech updates. 

As Troy said, everything that has been occurring over the past few weeks is super exciting.  Let's do the usual breakdown.  

### Smart Yield

#### Polygon / Matic (nearly complete)

**Bogdan:** You all know we are in the final stages of the Polygon deployment. We have a bit more testing to do. Regarding the movement of assets back a forth between the testnets. Before we enter production. 

The Polygon team is super helpful, assisting throughout all the steps in the process. We've remained in touch daily. 

We'll likely have a cool announcement with them in tandem! I don't want to talk too much about that. 

However, Smart Yield on Polygon will come very soon.  


#### Idle integration (nearly complete)

**Bogdan:** The second thing we've been doing is working closely with two well-known protocols‚Äì Idle, and I won't say anything about the second one. 

There are some Smart yield integrations and partnerships. Those weren't previously announced. However, both are in their final steps.   

### Gnosis Safe app support (nearly complete)

**Bogdan:** Whoever uses Gnosis safe will have the ability to use the app. Everything from BarnBridge will be available directly from the Gnosis Safe app.

* Yield Farming
* Governance 
* Smart Yield

### SECRET PROJECT (Smart Yield Compliment)

**Bogdan:** We've nearly finalized the spec‚Äì and we kicked off work on the Smart contracts for what's finished ‚Äìfor an exciting new product that is complimentary to Smart Yield. 

It's not only that. It's a useful solution that will serve the broader community and relieve some of the pressure/pain points we've encountered that keep Seniors from entering Smart Yield.

It's a solution dedicated to helping onboard Seniors to the product.

### Smart Exposure (nearly complete)

**Bogdan:** The app for that is almost finished. Front-end work is 90% done. All that is left is a matter of a final round of testing. Then deploying to mainnet and releasing everything into the wild.

A polygon version will also launch. Soon after the mainnet launch. (Smart Exposure will also be on Polygon)

### Smart Alpha (smart contracts started)

**Bogdan:** There have not been many updates lately with Smart Alpha. I can say we've kicked off work on the Smart contracts. Next week we should be working on the UI. 

That means Dennis and I should have some fun doing that. It should be familiar‚Äì it will probably look similar to Smart Yield. We're happy with the progress so far. 

We have a ton of cool product ideas. Some of them are starting to take shape. They're slowly getting moved up the backlog. 

Likely after we're done with Smart Alpha, we'll be starting on the next products. 

A lot in the pipeline.

Short and sweet! That's it on my end. 

**Troy:** Yeah!

**Tyler:** We've been deliberating a lot on the next product. I think Atpar is helping us. The next product is not one that we talked about in the community. This is what I would say a massive enhancement to Smart Yield‚Äì it's not what Bogdan's talking about. He's talking about what comes after Smart Alpha.

Some get affected by the market‚Äì not price ‚Äìthe ecosystem. And what is available on the market.

We have some great ideas. Smart Alpha will take some time, so we'll monitor the market in the meantime and make decisions accordingly. 

Atpar‚Äì after they help us with Smart exposure and the enhancement of Smart Yield. They'll be working on products that will likely playoff BarnBridge. I need to talk to the Synthetix community and how they did what they did with [Kwenta](https://kwenta.io/). 

It's all TBD, and nothings confirmed. We may not do it that way. I want to let the ecosystem know that we are thinking about complementary products.

I'm pretty excited. I said it on Twitter a while ago‚Äì we are firing on all cylinders on the dev side. 

So, once again, shoutout to DMOB!

**Troy:** Okay, that was a lot to compute. 

There is a lot of stuff coming down the pipeline and many plans‚Äì that's the TLDR.

## Operations [[06:33]](https://youtu.be/4dMYdgv8-PY?t=393)

**Troy:** I'm going to turn it over to Vitali to give us an update on their side.


### Vitali

**Vitali:** Hello, guys!

### Redesigns

**Vitali:** Recently, we were working on some design changes. Firstly, the website, the dark theme, it's 95% ready. The developer team started working on it, and it's looking very nice.

### Discord FAQ Bot (Updated‚Äì New release)

**Vitali:** The Discord FAQ bot is getting updated today. Along with some community questions. 

Such as; 

*Pavlo's Loop (finallyüòè)

### Marketing (brief)

**Vitali:** This week, we also devised a new marketing strategy. (a renewed plan)

There is a large amount of work on the way and a ton of updates. We'll be pushing out more and more content. Like educational materials, updated newsletters etc.

### DeFi Safety Score (Update)

**Vitali:** We have submitted the developer documentation update. The DeFi safety team is now reviewing our score, and that should be updated to reflect higher soon. 

I believe that's it on the operations side. 

Perhaps Mark or Max need to add to this. 

**Troy:** Max has some things that he will go over. More external updates vs internal. 

I'm looking forward to the Discord Bot FAQ update. The website looks awesome. (BTW) 

I love it. 

**Tyler:** Shout out to Dennis! 

I think it may have gone slightly unnoticed. That website is a result of an ongoing brand uplift. The designer to prepared the OG designs for BarnBridge wasn't Dennis. We stuck with it as long as we could until it wasn't sufficient from a UI perspective.  

Dennis created a new brand kit and did a bunch of work for that. Then he came back around and redid the website. So, while he was doing all the work for the designs for everything else we've cranked out‚Äì he also redefined the brand in the process. 

For a one-person designer‚Äì who has done a lot of UI and design work‚Äìthat's fucking incredible. So, shoutout to Dennis.

**Vitali:** Also, we are updating the BarnBridge branding slightly. You should expect our Social media banners to reflect the style of the website soon.  

**Troy:** Very cool! 

With that, I'll hand it over to Max. The community likely knows there has been a lot of developments there with integrations.

So, Max, please.

### Max

**Max:** Sure, I have a few external updates. The primary being 

### AAVE v2 Signaling

**Max:** The primary one is the Aave v2 market signalling that is occurring. Earlier this week, the team at Parafi Capital put up a proposal to get BOND listed as accepted collateral on Aave.

The way that process works and what they submitted is referred to as an ARC. Which is equivalent to our soft vote via snapshot with our community. If you haven't voted yet, take the time to make an Aave forum account. And submit your vote there. So that we can progress through the next steps of that process‚Äì which are fairly long.

It's important everyone shows up. 

### Bancor Snapshot #2 

**Max:** To quickly touch on what we're thinking about via a Governance perspective and within the BarnBridge community. I think the most pressing item that came up this week. A follow on deposit for the BOND/BNT Bancor pool. 

The 50,000 BOND was pledged to the pool (over the past week) represents about one-third of the co-investment opportunity. Voted in by the Bancor community.

So, topping that off would:

A. Provide far more BOND liquidity for the DEX markets
B. It opens up conversations for provisional liquidity mining rewards (for the BOND/BNT pool)

In conversations that the core team has had with numerous 'BNT whales,' it was well-received. We match the co-investment and accumulate BNT rewards (that may be eligible) instead of auto-dumping. There was a warm reception from that group of stakeholders. (whales) 

I think we may have a Snapshot vote about this. Around Friday or Saturday‚Äì it will stretch about five stays. 

I'm strongly in favour of adding BOND to that pool. To deepen that relationship and making it easier to roll out liquidity mining rewards. I believe it was pointed‚Äì with a BOND/BNT of this size, the liquidity mining rewards would near 40-60% annualized yield. 

It's coming to view‚Äì the DAO is both a coordination mechanism for what we are doing with BarnBridge and also a holding company of sorts. That carries several tokens related to the protocols that we interact with and their governance tokens. I think it becomes somewhat of a no-brainer. To deepen that relationship as much as possible.

### Rari Capital Consideration

**Max:** We've had a few projects that have reached out this week.  The team at Rari Capital asked us if we'd be interested in a Fuse pool for either BOND or BarnBridge related products. 

For those that are not familiar‚Äì Fuse pools are essentially forks of the original Compound code. So, you can create parameters for isolated margin pools/debt pools. 

I've thrown this in the ideas section of the forum, and I believe we have already received a good response from Mike987. He pointed out that while it may be a BOND Fuse pool. It doesn't make the most sense because there is already a Cream pool for BOND. It could be interesting to see if we can do a Fuse pool for either the Senior or Junior Smart Yield tranches. 

I'll be giving that comment more thought and sharing my ideas with the community about it via the forum thread.

Once there is more community discussion, we can return to the Rari team and then suggest an idea that runs through their governance process‚Äì to get a Fuse pool setup.

### Nexus Mutual (Update)

**Max:** We're getting close with Nexus Mutual on the insurance front. The community should expect a proposal going forward that bootstraps what is launched on that front. 

Whether that be:

- Shield Mining
  - Where BOND rewards are set aside for folks who take out insurance policies on the BarnBridge protocol

- The DAO itself issues insurance policies for the products
  - Covering Smart Yield contributions that may occur in the future

One nuance to point out here, Nexus Mutual carries a base rate of 2.6% regarding valuing premia.

What that means‚Äì if you would like deposit insurance on a Senior tranche, it becomes onerous. I believe that's where shield mining is an indirect subsidy mechanism for Seniors. That will all come over the next week or so, and of course, we'll have forum discussion and Snapshot votes.

Nothing will be fly-by-night. 

That should cover it in terms of relevant external updates for this call. 

### Quantstamp Article

**Max:** Another thing I wanted to point out, Quantstamp released a good article outlining the tranching space in DeFi. That went live on Wednesday.

### Tyler

### Sushi Onsen

**Tyler:** I have two updates

**Tyler:** One thing is that‚Äì the original proposal Max put forth before he was on the core team‚Äì Sushi Onsen, 0xMaki has been fairly slammed. I do believe that eventually, they'll set up Onsen for our Junior Side.

### Insurance

**Tyler:** I'm not sure when Bridge Mutual goes live, but I'm confident they'll be providing coverage for BarnBridge as well. 

The bigger update, I talked to the [Risk Harbor](https://www.riskharbor.com/) team. I think they're launching their product next week. 

Full disclosure on that one‚Äì I invested in that. But, I invested in literally every insurance product in the industry, in case you all think I'm shilling my bags.

They wrote special parameters as to where they can insure specific things about the NFTs. They went through our architecture and how it works. Creating proper pricing and how the insurance works on the Senior side. I think those kids are really smart and innovative. 

It's not only Nexus‚Äì obviously, they are the big dog‚Äì these other ones will need to prove themselves before others ape in. But, those projects got me excited from a tech & innovation perspective. 

Those are the few updates that I have off the top of my head. I'm sure there may be other things we haven't covered that we probably should. 

**Troy:** A lot is going on. We try and keep track of everything and go over it with these project calls. 

**Tyler:** I have another one, and It may be more critical. (I'm sorry for interrupting)

All the stuff with Aave is on their forum. (getting BOND listed as collateral)

In conjunction with that, I've been talking with Stani almost daily since he tweeted‚Äì [NFTs coming to Aave](https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov/status/1400638828264710144) ‚Äìand we need to have discussions with their team.  

Stani talks to me at a high level, nerding out on tech and getting excited. Verses his CTO‚Äì which would be pushing all of this forward from a tech perspective. I told Stani that if you bring NFTs to Aave, one of the best examples would be a BarnBridge Senior tranche. I'm not sure if they are working with Charged Particles.  

However, some way to value the NFT with ERC-20 cash flows makes it less demanding. The same way Risk Harbor played with our NFTs. Because you can run cash flow models on them. 

Stani agreed with that, and they're looking into our architecture on that side deeper. They'll have questions. I don't think we'll launch with them for v1. Because I think they are trying to start with‚Äì Lend with your PUNK‚Äì a simplistic approach. But, when they saw it and then thought of the potential, he got excited about it. 

He's been bumping his tech team about it. So, those are little things that we can chip at. Which will lead to big opportunities later.

Troy and I have been talking with Stani since February about that. So, it's cool to see that it's finally coming alive.

**Troy:** Yeah, it is! 

It should be cool to see what they come up with from a tech perspective.

## Round Table [[21:50]](https://youtu.be/4dMYdgv8-PY?t=1310)

**Troy:** With that, we have some questions from the community for the round table. 

This is a bit more directed at Bogdan. 

From Mike9870. Love ya, Mike!

**Question:**

> "How will the matic tokens be claimed in the Aave/Polygon market? Embedded in the spot yield or claimed separately?"

-Mike9870-

**Answer:**

**Troy:** Do we have that figured out yet? Will it be the same as how the Aave pools work now?

Or will it be claimed separately? 

**Bogdan:** They get claimed separately. It will be on Aave‚Äì the way we stake Aave now will be the same for when it's on Matic. 

You will need to stake your Junior tokens.

**Troy:** Right on! That's the last comment and all we had. 

So, this was a good call. 

Welcome, to the team Christian! (from the community)

A lot is going on, so I think we should give everyone 30 minutes of their day back. 

Peace out! ‚úåÔ∏è

**Everyone:** üëãüëãüëãüëãüëã
